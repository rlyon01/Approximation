""" Test the polynomial approximation for the abs function on a discrete grid.

This example is from:

  Ricardo PachÃ³n and Lloyd N. Trefethen, "Barycentric-Remez algorithms for best
  polynomial approximation in the chebfun system", BIT Numer Math (2009) 49,
  page 736.

A grid size of 48000 was used. A total of 24 iterations were required using the
first Remez algorithm. The approximation calculated by this test is close to
the results reported by the reference above, but it could be better.
