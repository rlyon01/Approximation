""" Test the polynomial approximation for the abs function.

This test uses Remez's second algorithm as implemented in the module
second_algorithm. This test is from:

  Ricardo PachÃ³n and Lloyd N. Trefethen, "Barycentric-Remez algorithms for best
  polynomial approximation in the chebfun system", BIT Numer Math (2009) 49,
  page 736.

A grid size of 9600 is used. A total of 5 iterations are required for the
algorithm to complete. The approximation calculated by this test is close to
the results reported by the reference above, but it could be better.

Module:
  second_abs_poly

Usage:
  >>> from second_abs_poly import main
  >>> main()

from second_algorithm import remez_poly
from utility import plot_result
