""" Test the polynomial approximation for the abs function.

This test uses Remez's first algorithm as implemented in the module
remes_first_algorithm. This test is from:

  Ricardo PachÃ³n and Lloyd N. Trefethen, "Barycentric-Remez algorithms for best
  polynomial approximation in the chebfun system", BIT Numer Math (2009) 49,
  page 736.

A grid size of 9600 is used. A total of 33 iterations are required for the
algorithm to complete. The approximation calculated by this test is close to
the results reported by the reference above, but could be better.

Module:
  first_abs_poly

Usage:
  >>> import first_abs_poly
  >>> main()
