# Chebyshev Approximation of a Function on a Linear Finite Point Set.

The python files in this repository are simple naive implementations of Reme's
first and second algorithms as applied to a polynomial of best approximation to
a function on a discrete linear grid. The purpose is to investigate the
limitations and issues when implementing Reme's algorithms in the most
straight-forward concide manner. A number of test cases are included.
